        "- A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer API) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. It allows different software systems to communicate over the internet using standard HTTP methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "Important RESTful API Concepts:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) Architecture of Client-Server:\n",
        "The server, which houses the data, and the client, such as a web or mobile application, are two distinct entities. Through API queries and answers, they exchange information.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Stateless: Every API request has all the data required to handle it. Between requests, the server does not save any client session information.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3) HTTP Techniques:\n",
        "Standard HTTP methods are used by RESTful APIs:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "GET: Get information\n",
        "\n",
        "POST: Generate fresh data\n",
        "\n",
        "PUT: Revise current data\n",
        "\n",
        "DELETE: Get rid of data\n",
        "\n",
        "Everything is regarded as a resource and is identifiable by a distinct URL (URI).\n",
        "\n",
        "4) For instance:\n",
        "\n",
        "GET /users - Obtain every user\n",
        "\n",
        "To obtain a user with ID 1, type GET /users/1.\n",
        "\n",
        "To create a new user, use POST /users.\n",
        "\n",
        "5) JSON or XML: Typically, data is transmitted and received in either the more popular JSON format or XML.\n",
        "\n",
        " 6) Uniform Interface: REST simplifies and standardizes APIs by enforcing a common method of interacting with resources."
